Retail BI Dashboards – Sales & Customer Analysis (Tableau Public)
Project Overview
This project replaces static Excel reports with an interactive Business Intelligence solution built in Tableau Public.
Two interconnected dashboards — Sales and Customer — were developed to enable dynamic Year-over-Year performance analysis and customer loyalty insights.
The solution emphasizes interactivity, clean UX/UI design, and advanced analytical features such as parameters, Level of Detail (LOD) expressions, and dynamic time calculations.
Objectives
Transform business requirements into actionable visual analytics.
Apply a structured BI workflow: Analysis → Data → Visualizations → Dashboard.
Implement dynamic Year-over-Year (YoY) calculations.
Use Parameters and LOD expressions for segmentation and flexibility.
Deliver a professional and user-friendly dashboard design.
Enable stakeholders to explore performance data interactively.
